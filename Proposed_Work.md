# Proposed work over the next 8 weeks (short and long term):

1) For the next 1-2 of weeks, I would like to explore how the ISBN prefixes could be used to identify possible clusters of publisher entities. Also, what are the kind of information they provide us with? Can we parse the ISBN fields for a better classification of material type?

2) To explore the different fields of the MARC records (along with the linked data) to evaluate their importance in clustering publisher entities. We will need to balance the computational efficiency with accuracy, as we will try to build a more scaleable algorithm in the later stages.

3) To compare the efficiencies of different clustering algorithms and representations (Word vectors, tf-idf, bag-of-words, etc.) for gold standard data.
